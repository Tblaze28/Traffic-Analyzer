# Traffic-Analyzer

This Network Traffic Analyzer tracks your internet interface that you choose. Once you are done tracking, the program will give you two images, one with the type of traffic broken down in a pie chart, the other a bar graph of the top sourced IPs.

HOW TO INSTALL:

1. Go to your cmd prompt, create a folder for this program specifically and use "git clone https://github.com/Tblaze28/Traffic-Analyzer"
2. Make sure you have python, scapy, and matplotlib installed
3. Edit the "main.py" towards the bottom to include your "iface" (typically eth0 or lo0, find with if/ipconfig)
4. Run "python3 main.py"
5. Use "Ctrl + C" to end the program and get your results! It will save the file under a new "logs" folder.

ENJOY!
